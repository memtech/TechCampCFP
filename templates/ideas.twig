    <h2 class="headline--beta">Call for Papers Talk Ideas</h2>
    <p>
        {{ site.title }} is not limited to just PHP-related talks. There have been
        sessions covering a wide range of topics supporting PHP developers and DevOps
        as well, and we encourage you to "think outside the box" to come up with your
        own unique topics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to financial constraints most conferences tend to pick speakers to present
        multiple talks. Therefore <strong>it is advisable to submit a few talk ideas, not just one.</strong>
        By submitting a single talk you may lessen your chances of being selected.
    </p>
    <p>
        To get the ideas flowing, here's a few suggestions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Virtualization and environments</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>Alternate PHP run-times</li>
        <li>PHP internals</li>
        <li>Development principles</li>
        <li>Security</li>
